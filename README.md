# Pure HTML Calculator

#### Because why not?

This little program builds a static pure html calculator into the `build` folder. The calculations are limited to two two-digit numbers and an operator. Beware that every possible calculation has to be performed and written in a different `.html` file at buildtime. Because of this, expect the `build` folder to weigh hundreds of megabytes.

**Warning**: runs in non-linear space when using runhaskell. Compile it first.

A prebuilt version is available [here](http://fgaz.github.io/pure-html-calc).
